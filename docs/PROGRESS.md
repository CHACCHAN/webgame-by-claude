# Progress log

Newest first. "Verified" means actually executed in this environment; anything else is marked as unverified.

## Session 1 (2026-10-30)

### Environment survey
- Tools: Docker 29 + Compose v5 (daemon started manually; Docker Hub 429 → mirror.gcr.io), PHP 8.3, Composer,
  Node 22, Python 3.13 (numpy, PIL), ffmpeg, ImageMagick, Playwright 1.63 + Chromium (SwiftShader WebGL).
- Network: npm, Packagist, PyPI, GitHub raw, mcr.microsoft.com, Ubuntu apt OK. Asset sites blocked (see ASSETS.md).

### Done & verified
- Laravel API (players/runs/leaderboard/ghosts) — 8 feature tests pass (`php artisan test`).
- Docker Compose stack (db/app/web) builds and runs; `/api/health`, player registration, run submission and
  leaderboard verified with curl through nginx → PHP-FPM → PostgreSQL.
- Course + terrain generation; layout checked with top-down/hillshade renders (no overlapping legs).
- Vehicle physics + AI: headless sim — all 3 cars × 3 AI levels finish the course with 0 respawns
  (legend: HAYATE 117.4 s, RAIJIN 98.6 s, SHIDEN 105.0 s).
- Frontend builds (`tsc -b`, `vite build`). Headless browser screenshots verified: title, menu, garage,
  countdown/HUD, driving, environment views (city lights, bridge, vista, hairpins).
- Bugs found & fixed via screenshots: sky shader used reserved GLSL word `flat`; road mesh and roadside
  sweeps had inverted winding (road invisible, black curb lines).

### Known issues / next
- Night visuals: balance still being tuned; terrain readability; lamp light pools on the road.
- Car models are procedural — readable but low-detail. A GLB override path would allow dropping in better models.
- Driving feel not yet tuned with scripted manoeuvre tests; drift assist values are first guesses.
- No e2e Playwright suite yet; no seeded bot ghosts yet.
- Performance on a real GPU unmeasured (cloud VM has no GPU; SwiftShader gives ~1–6 fps).
